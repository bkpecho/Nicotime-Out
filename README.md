This repository contains the code for Nicotime-Out, an Android application developed as an undergraduate thesis project. The aim of Nicotime-Out is to assist smokers in overcoming their addiction to cigarettes. By leveraging the power of mobile technology, the application provides various features and tools to support users on their journey towards a smoke-free life.

## Features

- **Animated Infographics**: Nicotime-Out incorporates animated infographics to educate users about the harmful effects of smoking. Topics covered include the composition of cigarettes, health effects of smoking, understanding cigarette addiction, and a comprehensive quit smoking guide.

- **Health Progress and Savings Tracker**: The application allows users to track their progress in quitting smoking by providing a health progress and savings tracker. Users can monitor the number of smoke-free days, track their financial savings, and view the health benefits they have achieved since quitting.

- **Quit Smoking Timeline**: Nicotime-Out includes a quit smoking timeline that showcases the positive effects of quitting cigarettes over time. This feature serves as a visual reminder of the health improvements users can experience as they stay smoke-free.

- **Integrated Gamification**: To enhance motivation and engagement, the application incorporates gamification elements. Users can earn achievements and milestones as they progress on their smoke-free journey. An interactive progress bar provides a sense of accomplishment and encourages users to stay committed to quitting.

- **Rehabilitation Centers**: Nicotime-Out provides information about Department of Health (DOH) accredited cigarette addiction rehabilitation centers in the Philippines. Users can access details such as contact information, location, and available programs to support them in seeking professional help if desired.
